# Hangman game in JAVA

I have made a hangman game in JAVA in which you have to place letter by letter in the console and you have a certain number of attempts. If you manage to complete the whole word you win, otherwise, if you run out of attempts, you lose.

## What tools have I used?
1. Scanner class.
2. Statements and assignments.
3. Arrays.
4. Control structure: iterative (loop).
5. Control structure: conditional.
6. The String class and its methods valueOf(), charAt() and length(). 
7. Character class and its toLowerCase() method.
